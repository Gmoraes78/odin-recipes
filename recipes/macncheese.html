                "I saw Paula Deen make this recipe on her Food Network program. 
                I was looking for a really creamy macaroni and cheese recipe, 
                and this is it! I changed it a bit by omitting the eggs 
                (the original recipe calls for three) and boiling the macaroni 
                for six minutes instead of seven, so it doesn't get mushy while cooking 
                in the Crockpot. I also shortened the cooking time from three to two and 
                a half hours. Perfection!"
