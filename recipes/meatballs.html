                "Meatball recipes are often challenged by chefs who claim, "Mine are the best!" 
                Even though my meatballs ARE the best, I will make no such claim. Try them for yourself! 
                This meatball recipe was given to me by my father who got it from a little old lady from Italy that he knew. 
                It's amazing that she gave up her recipe to him, but I sure am glad she did!"
